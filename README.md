#Soil_metagenomics

This repo contains different scripts that were written for the purpose of analysisng soil metagenomics data. 
Two challenges were associated with this project:
1. Databases containing soil microbiota are very few and contain very little information while the soil itself is highly diverse
2. The dataset was not uniform, two samples were 16S metagenomics data and one shotgun data due to confusion on the collaborators side

To solve these challenges I utilized QIIME2 for the 16S data and different short reads metagenomic profilers.these included metaphlan, kaiju, and squeezemeta
